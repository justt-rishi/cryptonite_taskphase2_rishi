In this challenge, we were not given much information on what to look for or do, other than the fact it had something to do with cookies. We were given a web link for this
challenge which took us to this page:-

It was easy to guess that it had to do something with cookies ( from the name of the challenge itself). I then had to do some research work on how to view at the cookies for 
a certain website using the inspect tool in the browser. The cookies for a website are stored in the website's application tab. He is the cookies tab for this website:-

My first search was Snickerdoodle as it was a hidden (but can be seen on the home page) hint. This was the result of the first search:- 

<img width="959" alt="Name 0" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a233972-f660-4216-b6ee-d4aea7897b12" />

I observed that for the first guess the value of the name cookie changed from -1 to 0. This meant I had to do trial and error to get the flag. From binary search method I 
found out that the last value for name was 29 as it threw an error for name value 30:-

From here on I kinda just tested my luck by trying random numbers. I got the flag for name value number 18:-

## The flag for this challenge is:- picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_bb3b3535}
