In this challenge we were required to get the flag by using the 'XML external entity Injection' exploit. We were required to read the "/etc/passwd" file in the given html 
instance. We were also given a web portal of adress "http://saturn.picoctf.net:60143/". 
This is how the interface of the web portal was:-

From the given information first I needed to understand the information given in the hint. What is XML external entity injection. To learn more i searched it up on google,
and got all the information required to finish this challenge from this website "https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe". 
I learnt that:-
1) XML external entity injection (also known as XXE) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data.
    It often allows an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem, and to interact with any back-end or external systems that the application itself can
    access.
2) What a Burp suite was. (Burp Suite:- Burp Suite is a Java-based web security testing tool that helps identify vulnerabilities in web applications).

From this info I learnt that first I needed to download burp suite software so I can intercept the request being sent by the web portal when I select the picoctf tab.
I turned the Intercept On in the burp suite software and put the web portal link adress in the burp suite web browser. I then proceeded to forward the request and which opened 
the website. I then clicked on the pico ctf tab. This request was intercepted by the burp software. I sent the request deets to the repeater to do my experimentation. From 
this website "https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe", I learned that this is used to exploit and get the /etc/passwd file, "<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc
/passwd">]>". Then I had to get the data out by using "&xxe;". You can find how i did it in the picture below.

## THE FLAG IS:- picoCTF{XML_3xtern@l_3nt1t1ty_e79a75d4}
