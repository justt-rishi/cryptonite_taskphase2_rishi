# Forbidden Path
In this challenge we were provided with the information that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt. We were also told that the 
website is filtering absolute file paths. Which means we had to use relative paths to read the /flag.txt file. 
From Linux Luminariam (PWN College): We know './' is the current directory and '../' is parent directory.
So to reach to the /flag.txt file we need to move 4 folders up (from /usr/share/nginx/html/ to / the root folder where the flag is at)..
This can be done by using '../'. As we need to move 4 folders up we use '../' 4 times. Therefore the path to get the flag will be "../../../../flag.txt".
Upon typing this in and selecting read on the website it gave us the flag.
