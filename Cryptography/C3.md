In this challenge we were given an encrtypted message(DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEker
FlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl). We were also given an encoder....Upon downloading the
encoder it was a .py file.....which means it was a python script. 
The file contents:-
```
import sys
chars = ""
lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
    cur = lookup1.index(char)
    out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
    prev = cur

sys.stdout.write(out)
```
As the description said it was a Custom Cyclical Cipher..it was natural for me to assume that this was the custom part and the hint said"Modern crypto schemes don't depend on 
the encoder to be secret, but this one does". I ran this python script with the message in the chars place.

The output was the letters adlibs. So I tried the flag format picoCTF{adlibs}....and it worked.

## The Flag for this challenge:- picoCTF{adlibs}
