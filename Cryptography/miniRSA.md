# miniRSA
In this challenge we were give n,e and c of a RSA encryption. We were suppoed to decrypt this message to get the flag. We were also given a wikepedia page on this cipher. 
It seemed almost impossible to do this manually, so I searched for online decryptor. Almost all of them said the ciphered text was too long. But then I found a github page which
had the tools required to decipher the chipher here is the link:- https://github.com/Heisenberk/rsa-ctf-tool/tree/master.

Using their prebuilt libraries:
```Python
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes

After savig this file I ran it on command prompt to get this:-
