# MatchTheRegex
In this challenge, we were asked to launch the instance and match the website's regex (regular expression). Upon browsing through the web I came down to this definition for 
regex "A regular expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern." 

After I launched the instance I was given a website link. I opened the source code hoping there I would find the regex, and I found this:-

Here, we can see the regex for the flag is anything starting with p, having some characters in between, and ending with F.

So I went to the page and searched picoCTF, and it gave me the flag:-

<img width="959" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2e77d8d-bf59-4a6b-9dbc-82a87473b946" />

## The flag for this challenge is:- picoCTF{succ3ssfully_matchtheregex_2375af79}
