I am genuinely confused with this challenge as I had nothing to do lmao. I had to run the instance and connect to the pico servers and find the right burger for Patrick and
Spongebob through trial and error. I think luck was on my side......literally got the flag on the 2nd try. I don't know if I did the challenge wrong but there was literally no
need for the source file and the BIN file at all. 
Here is a screenshot of my wsl bash lines:-
